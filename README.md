# Digital-Diary-web-application
A internet and web probramming project

Our project is a web application which provides users to maintain a digital diary. 
Since users would like to ensure their privacy for what they write here, appropriate functions are used to protect their data. 
The project outcome is to present a more functional and efficient way to maintain their diaries than the traditional paper diaries.
It will offer a range of advantages compared to the paper version of diaries.
